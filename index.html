            My name is Jaime Villa. I am an Electronic Engineer, graduated from the Universidad de Valladolid, and I hold a Master’s degree in Robotics and Automation.
        </p>
        <p class="text-section">
            Currently, I am pursuing a PhD at the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, where I contribute as a researcher in the <a href="https://lsi.uc3m.es/" target="_blank" class="glow-link">Intelligent Systems Lab (LSI)</a>.
            My work focuses on deep learning and computer vision, developing advanced algorithms for robotic systems, particularly autonomous driving vehicles. In addition to my academic journey, I have professional experience in industrial automation and robotics, where I implemented solutions to optimize processes and enhance system performance. However, my true passion lies in research and the pursuit of innovative solutions to complex problems.

            Beyond technology, sports have been an important part of my life. For many years, I played rugby, an experience that taught me the value of teamwork, discipline, and commitment—principles I apply to my professional and research career.  In 2021, I co-founded a powerlifting club, where <a href="https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/jaimevillaplaza" target="_blank" class="glow-link">I competed as an active member</a>. Powerlifting, as an individual sport, taught me the importance of self-reliance and resilience, and it reinforced my belief that success comes from hard work.
