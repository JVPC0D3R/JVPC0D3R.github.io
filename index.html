            Hi! I'm Jaime Villa, an Electronic Engineer and Researcher in Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
        </p>
        <p class="text-section">
            I’m pursuing a PhD at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid and work as a Researcher in the <a href="https://lsi.uc3m.es/" target="_blank" class="glow-link">Intelligent Systems Lab (LSI)</a>. My research applies Deep Learning and Computer Vision to Autonomous Vehicles and Infrastructure Traffic Supervision systems. I also have Industry experience in PLC automation and robotics, where I’ve implemented solutions to streamline processes and improve system performance.

            Alongside my technical work, sports have played a significant role in my life. I played rugby, which helped me develop teamwork, discipline, and commitment. In 2021, I co-founded a powerlifting club and <a href="https://www.openpowerlifting.org/u/jaimevillaplaza" target="_blank" class="glow-link">competed as an active member</a>. Through powerlifting, I learned self‑reliance, resilience, and that consistent effort leads to results.
